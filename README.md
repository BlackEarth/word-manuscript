# word-manuscript

This repository contains a Word template / add-in that you can use for your Microsoft Word manuscripts. The template is in the Templates subfolder. The simplest way to use it is to double click on the template in Finder (macOS) or Explorer (Windows). This will create a new document based on the template, which will give you access to all of the templateâ€™s capabilities.

Complete documentation for the template is available in the Documents subfolder. This documentation should be in sync with the version of the template that you have downloaded.
